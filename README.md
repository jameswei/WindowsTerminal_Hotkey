# Windows Hotkey

## What and Why ?

Basically, this's a personal collection of useful scripts about working on Windows 10.

In the past years, I mainly worked on MacOS and occasionally Ubuntu. Recently I've to shift to Windows, that's quite unfamiliar to me, at any aspect.
So I'm getting into it and trying to make it more efficient to me.

## How to use ?

* Install [AutoHotKey](https://www.autohotkey.com) on Windows
either via Microsoft Store
or ```choco install autohotkey```, 
or ```scoopy install autohotkey```, 
or download & install from AutoHotKey homepage.
* execute any given script file as you like, and enjoy it.

## What's in it ?
* wt_toggle.ahk

``` Ctrl+` ``` to show/hide WindowsTerminal, like [Guake](http://guake-project.org/) on Ubunut.

* rev_scroll.ahk

reverse the mouse scroll direction, like in MacOS.
