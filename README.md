# Windows Hotkey
---

## What and Why ?

Basically, this's a personal collection of useful scripts about working on Windows 10.

In the past years, I mainly worked on MacOS and occasionally Ubuntu. Recently I've to shift to Windows, that's quite unfamiliar to me, at any aspect.
So I'm getting into it and trying to make it more efficient to me.

## What should I do ?

* Install [AutoHotKey](https://www.autohotkey.com) on Windows
either via Microsoft Store
or ```choco install autohotkey```, 
or ```scoopy install autohotkey```, 
or any other package manager you like.

## What's in it ?
* wt_toggle.ahk

``` Ctrl+` ``` to show/hide WindowsTerminal, like [Guake](http://guake-project.org/) on Ubunut.

## How to contribute ?
Please feel free to let me know if there's any mistake or suggestion.

Pull request is highly welcomed. :)
